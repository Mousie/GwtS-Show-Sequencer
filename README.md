This script will calculate a full 9x command given the raw commands.

Additionally, if given command line arguments, this script will generate a set of show commands with proper offsets
compatible with Jon Fether's Mouse Ear Recording Playback Tool.
The first argument is the input filename.
The second argument is optional and is the output filename. If no name is given, a default of "output.txt" will be used.
e.g. python GwtSDemo input_file_name.txt output_file_name.txt
